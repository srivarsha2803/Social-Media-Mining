"I messed around with it at first because it was interesting to explore ideas and tweak them, but in the end it felt really empty and I gained nothing from the experience. Realized it was basically the equivalent of having a very specific google image search. Kind of feels like the antithesis of creativity.",,1,,,,Negative,Ethically Outraged
"You have to be human to make real art in my opinion. The computer removes all traces of the human hand. Yes a human is operating the computer but the A.I. or digital capabilities are mimicking and imitating what can be done with real tools in the real world, to me its all cheap and artificial. I’m against A.I. all together, it’s going to destroy humanity. But thats just me.",1,,,,,Negative,Dismissive

"It's a very useful tool that is very, very easy to use as a crutch and let it ""do all the work for you"". When I use it, I try to only use it as reference or to colour pick from. But anyone who says it doesn't require effort has simply not used it for anything more complex than ""portrait of a woman, trending on artstation"".
I have several original characters with very unique designs that simply cannot be replicated with prompting alone. I used Mitsua diffusion (a model trained on copyright-free images) and fine-tuned it with my own art to mimic my style. Then I spent hours making 3d models of my characters and their clothes, hours more rendering 10 or so images for each with different backgrounds/lighting, then trained embeddings on these images so I could use them in prompts. Only after that does Stable Diffusion give me coherent images that actually resemble my characters.
And THEN I take that image and I either paint over it almost entirely or I use it as reference. If I'm feeling particularly cheaty, I'll nick the background and blur it.
I recognize that this is not the use case that most people think of when they say ""AI art is theft"", but this is a use case that will be unfairly affected if anti-AI legislation goes ahead without exception",,1,,,,Positive,Supportive
"It’s a cool novelty and occasionally a useful tool in the process of art-making, but it’s not really “art” itself. Art requires intention, and a computer has no intentions of its own, just the ability to recognize and replicate patterns.

"Gives people dopamine for very little actual involvement, but they take credit and feel entitled to the same spaces as those who actually go through the process. It's also easy to confuse ""I spent x hours it was really hard!"" as if it equates to having made the picture yourself. You can spend a hundred hours in emails and calls with an artist on a project but you do not get to say you drew what you had commissioned.",,1,,,,Negative,Ethically Outraged

"I find AI art very unethical as many AI art companies use copyrighted images made by artists and/or photographers without the artists'/photographers' consent or knowledge or giving compensation. Even though I know that AI art is going to be the future and there's no stopping it, at least make AI art a tool to help artists, not steal from them, or to help artists make a profit or give credit to the original artist. It's kinda like if you're doing a group project and nobody gives you any credit even though you're the only one doing the work. However, I have learned that some AI generated art engines are being more ethical with the images they source.",1,,,,,Negative,Ethically Outraged
"AI generated imagery is a commodity, like an ikea desk.the person assembling an ikea desk is not a woodcrafter now is he? an ikea desk, much like AI is simply a marvel of engineering, designed so anyone can put it together to serve a use.",,1,,,,Negative,Dismissive
"AI art can be cool visually, but it’s infinitely more impressive when I see something and find out it was made by a person, whether it is digital art or really any craft. Buying something hand-drawn or handmade is so special, and I don’t think AI art can ever replace that feeling, even if it can make visually interesting images",,,,1,,Negative,Apprehensive
"People who use AI to make 'art' are not artists. Traditional artists who think digital art is 'cheating' don't really know what they're talking about. I do think that AI can be useful for artists- CSP is the art program I personally use, and it has many AI features- but an image fully created by AI is not art. Also, most AI art being developed is not meant to supplement hand-made art, but to replace it.",1,,,,,Negative,Dismissive
It's not gonna replace art made by real people. People need to calm thier jits.,,,,,1,Positive,Enthusiastic
"I'm not against AI art in and of itself, just the art theft aspect of it. If you only ever fed the AI your own artwork, I could see it being a tool for artists to make the art process easier. However, right now that isn't what is happening. Right now, AI is a tool for art thieves to steal work easier without giving due credit.",1,,,,,Negative,Dismissive
"Commenting to stay on this thread, but I couldn't agree more. Art has always been and always will be about making something that has soul, and you can feel that when you see it. It's one of those things that I haven't been able to yet find words for, but I really, really empathize with this statement. Edit: Oh man has this thread made me consider what makes art “art”, and while I still think that the soul and the emotion behind a piece is my favorite part, there’s so much complexity to define art.",,,,1,,Negative,Apprehensive
Arguing over how well AIs counterfeit art misses the point. AI is fundamentally antihuman. Its mere existence reflects an antihuman attitude that reduces everything to commodities and machine components. People are not commodities or components. A civilization that doesn’t realize that is doomed.,,,,,1,Negative,Apprehensive
"I'm into drawing and I'm into AI. I like having an artist touch up and merge AI generated images. It can also fill things like crowds for you. It's another tool, sort of like photo bashing Oh and it's helpful for clients to communicate what they want in the final image",,1,,,,Positive,Supportive

"Wassily Kandinsky had this to say regarding composition in his book Point and Line to Plane: ""My definition of the concept ""composition"" Is as follows: A composition is the inwardly-purposeful subordination of the Individual elements and 1. of the build-up (construction) 2. toward the goal of concrete pictoriality. Also, when a single sound completely embodies the pictorial aim, this single sound must be considered the equivalent of a composition. The single sound here is a composition."" I think AI generated art is indeed art. You purposefully subordinate the individual elements and also the construction of them toward a picture. Music is a good example of something coming a long way where nowadays we have producers who produce incredible music in EDM all with computer programs and not knowing even an iota of music theory. AI generated art can be viewed in a similar vein. More than that, with the rise of conceptual art, AI generated art falls into that definition exceptionally well. What was the idea the artist had behind the conception of the piece? The fact that an AI was used in its generation just means it was made with non-traditional materials and mediums much like other pieces of conceptual art. Personally, I see nothing wrong with that. That being said, if someone lies about it, that's a completely different matter.",,1,,,,Positive,Supportive
"I'd like to go about this another way and say this : It's not really what AI art is trying to replicate. While it may lack the ""heart and soul"" of art, and may never replicate it, AI art doesn't aim to do that. It aims to make the actual product, the result, as fast and as cheap as possible. And, unfortunately, the actual finished pieces is what brings the money to the table. While the soul of a piece is very important to an artist and a part of artistic audiences, for most, what matter most is the physical product, what you can directly see, and is thus what's gonna end up being prioritized on a larger scale. Saying we're better at art than AI because our art is more ""real"" would be like saying a bike is better as a method of transport compared to cars because it can go offroad. While, yes, a bike has a lot of advantages cars will never achieve, they are, for most people, irrelevant. For most people, the key factor is using what will allow them to travel (more or less) large distances as fast, as effortlessly, and as easily as possible. And, no matter how greener, healthier, and flexible a bike can be, a car is just gonna be faster when you want to go from city to city. Disclaimer : This comment does not aim at bashing bikes. I am well-aware bikes can be really handy in urban areas in order to avoid traffic, are greener than cars, etc... I just used it as an example to underline the way people determine their ""most important factors"" can drastically change what options they might go for, in turn drastically turning away from those ""less desirable"" options",,,1,,,Neutral,Neutral
"I don’t know that we’re better, but I do know that we’ll still be here with the need to make art when ai art goes out of fashion. I don’t make art just because I like it (though I do of course), I make it because I have to",,,,1,,Negative,Apprehensive
I'm the type of artist people make fun of. My favorite art is abstraction and it's often what I'm best at. It's energetic and full of movement and emotions. AI COULD NEVER construct what I do. The current public and commerical world doesn't neccessary care for it. I don't do character design or anything that can be really comercialized. But I don't care. It's that soul you mention that AI can't take away,1,,,,,Negative,Dismissive
AI is inevitable. It is in the beginning fase but when it gets finetuned it will take over the whole art game. Only things physical will stay alive. Everything digital will get out done by AI technology. Why would someone pay for a graphic designer or designs when you can just give prompts and let a computer program whatever you visualize in your mind,,,,,1,Positive,Enthusiastic
"No one ever likes my perspective, but whatever, I guess I'm a glutton for punishment. I'm a weird nerd who is a hybrid creative/engineer type, not entirely one or the other, so I bring both to my art.I think humans are not special. Philosophically, I'm not even sure we have free will rather than just being really complicated models for processing environmental factors and spitting out behavior on the other side. IMO, the only reason we're better at art than AI has nothing to do with some magic of consciousness or uniquely human creativity and more to do with how complex our brains are compared to a computer. Right now, it's very hard to simulate human neural behavior; it's so intense that we need special supercomputers to do it. Deep South is the newest one, if I recall, in Australia. Its aim is to mimic one entire human brain.Being creatures of limited perspective and with an affinity for our own ways of thought, we're making AIs that learn like we do: trial and error based on observations of the outside world. Draw a box around a beginning artist and around an AI so you can't tell what's inside either, and there isn't much difference in how they learn art. Pick a box and show it some references, and whatever is in the box will look at them and output something that looks somewhat like those references. Now, input critique of the resulting work compared to some standard you hold. The box will shift its work to eliminate flaws you mentioned and expand on the parts you liked. Occasionally, a new behavior will pop up, and then it gets either rewarded or punished based on the feedback on the artwork being produced.(Yes, AIs can be ""creative"" -- they can try random stuff and then assess whether or not they get good feedback on their new effort. It's called a genetic breeding model; you have random ""mutations"" in the algorithm, and the strong ones survive. Same as humans coming up with new ideas.)Eventually, assuming a complex enough AI, you will not be able to tell who did what. We don't have that complicated an AI yet, but I assure you we will get there someday. The key part here is that as much as people cringe to hear it, we are just meat computers. We are reacting to external stimuli with predictable responses. We don't pull ideas and ability out of a vacuum; it's all determined by the same environmental factors we can show to a computer.Very few artists make ""their own style"" out of absolute nowhere. I'm sure there are some occasional savants who seem to just invent stuff whole cloth (and I don't think that's what actually happened), but in general, like all the rest of your behavior, your art style is a blend of what you see around you, how you see others in your field performing, and how well your body moves in response to the commands you give it. To condense this wall of text: humans are just meat computers, and lots of people are insecure about how we're not special, and someday we'll make a metal computer that's as good as a meat computer, and they will do art as well as we do. There is no inherent value to human behavior compared to a computer unless you choose to assign it one, and even then, people should acknowledge that the only meaning it has is that they feel the warm fuzzies about it.",,1,,,,Positive,Supportive
"Nobody cares what makes art real. Commissions are down due to AI art and that's it. It doesn't matter what you reason or convince yourself of because the reality is if other people don't acknowledge it, it doesn't matter. The average buyer is going to spend their money on something that is worth it in their eyes and obviously, AI art is the cheaper alternative. Unfortunate but true. If we were truly better than AI art we would be getting commissions.",,,,,1,Negative,Apprehensive

"They're built on training data used without consent, are incapable of generating anything that isn't in the training data, and will spit out exact copies of training data when overfitted or under-trained, which is basically another way of saying ""when it isn't hidden as well"".You've got an awfully confident opinion that it isn't stealing for someone who clearly knows nothing about how they work.Edit since the kid blocked the reply:You don't know what you're talking about. A single website saying they're working with artists doesn't mean anything. I'm not anti AI tech, I'm anti plagiarism.Since you know nothing about the subject, I suggest you try and learn rather than assume you're right.You genuinely think it learns concepts. It removes noise from a seed image. It doesn't know what anything is, it's not actually intelligent.For gods sake learn even the most basic thing about the subject before parading around acting like your opinion on it is worth anything.

"I do consider it art. Think about a film director. He or she has a vision, but it’s up to the lighting technicians, the cinematographer, and countless other people to achieve that result. But we’d still consider Stanley Kubrick or Wes Anderson an artist even if they delegate their ideas to other people. There’s certainly a large skill gap between someone like Da Vinci and someone typing “oil painting of a Renaissance-era woman,” but the end result is art, whether or not you consider the author an “artist.”",,1,,,,Positive,Supportive
AI art is just art direction. You aren’t creating anything. The program you are directing is creating it. You are no more creating art than someone who goes to an artist and commissions a painting of a bluebird with laser beams coming out if it’s eyes flying over Big Ben. If my friend told me to draw a picture of something and I produce it they have not created art. This is all you do with AI art. Just act as an art director. I do like AI art and it’s fun as hell to play around with. I just don’t consider myself as creating art with it.,,1,,,,Neutral,Neutral
"I think the main problem, and why people are getting tired of AI art, is that it's pretty much available to anyone. Consequently, the feeds get saturated with low-effort and unimaginative work. People are so impressed by it that they feel the need to post their mediocre work all the time. That's the other problem — AI tools can quickly produce something. So, instead of a painter who takes days, weeks, or months to create art, we now have a bunch of easily impressed people who are given the chance to quickly produce their own art, thus spamming the feeds with low-effort renders. The effort and time investing to gain a skill is non-existent. That's why it's so attractive to lazy people with no imagination/creativity. Something that is good and well produced (ai art-wise) gets lost in the sea of doo-doo.",,1,,,,Negative,Ethically Outraged
"People don't have a common definition of art so you'll get different responses depending on that. Personally I think art is whatever the creator says is art. I.e. it's all about intent.

"Of course its Art, take found art for instance, that could be something , anything you find in life that seems beautiful to you and that you interpret as Art, certainly one can find art in an image created by a computer as much as you could find art in a swirl of dirt on a windowpane or a crack in a vase that might be filled with gold and called art, nowhere in the definition of art does it say it has to be the result of a difficult process, or the result of years of formal training or even that it be created by a human being!

"I think it's art in the same way a mass produced watch is a watch. That is to say it is art, but there's just something special about a meticulously hand crafted watch.

"Art is subjective. Some will, some won't. I don't particularly find a lot of generally considered set pieces artistic, others do. A lot of AI art does nothing for me, sometimes it does.

But what I think doesn't matter in the end, art is subjective.",,,1,,,Neutral,Neutral
"It depends on what you define as ""art"". Most people define art as something created by a human in order to evoke some kind of emotion for the primary purpose of evoking emotion. A jar of piss can be art, it doesn't mean it's good art or that it's worth any more than a jar of piss, but if a person brings it to an art gallery and puts it on a pedastal and fixes a wanky descriptor to it, then it becomes art. It's still disgusting worthless trash, but something being ""art"" isn't a statement of value, it's just a categorization. I wouldn't consider AI images art because they're created by a machine. The Machine can't think about what it's doing and the images it creates are based on an algorithm, not on actual creativity. Just like I wouldn't consider something painted by a dog to be art, even though it might functionally be the same as abstract art - the dog doesn't know what it's doing, it just knows that if it does stuff with the brush a certain way it gets treats. Or anything created primarily to promote a specific ideological group, which is propaganda.",1,,,,,Negative,Dismissive
"Why wouldn't you say that AI isn't art? I'll say it: AI isn't art. Art comes from a different way of seeing the world. Every piece of art that was created in history was shaped by someone's human experiences. Art has become a very wide-ranging category in which almost everything can become art, but I'm pretty sure the process of stealing the work of millions of other artists and pressing a button to regurgitate amalgamated slop isn't art, because none of it was created with imagination. AI art is created with other people's imaginations and the generative process of a machine. It will never create anything new.",1,,,,,Negative,Dismissive
"AI is a tool, it doesn't include creativity or emotions. The user has doesn't have full control over the output and AI is far from being good enough to be used like everyone is imagining.

Focus on what you want to do, because AI won't do it for you.",,1,,,,Neutral,Neutral
"I disagree that is squashes creativity. To me, creativity just means like having an idea to make something. Whatever process is used to make it is irrelevant, the idea is the creative part. I think there's a lot of problems with AI but that's not one of them. If anything it just lowers the barrier for creative expression. Currently making art is kind of gatekept by the technical ability required to make art. If non artists can make good art, then it's probably a net increase in the amount of creative expression in the world. I don't think we're there yet but if the technology keeps improving we will be",,1,,,,Positive,Supportive
"I do not agree with the use of Ai. It's annoying, I feel like it's trying to deceive people. There are art platforms that are full of profiles with variations of the same piece, some of which are truly incredible. However, there is always an artist that was used, but we don't know who, as the user often mixes several. But perhaps, like many technologies that have been denied in the past. This is another one that is facing initial denial, only to later be accepted as an alternative to perfecting and creating art, but with limitations of use",1,,,,,Negative,Dismissive

"I feel like you have to distinguish between art and commercially commodified images. The first will always require human creativity and contains what I believe people call ""The Soul"". The second one usually has a pretty clear right or wrong and is usually embedded in a bigger product. In a lot of instances of the second case, humans currently really only serve as human rendering machines. There is often very little creativity involved. It's about churning out high quality images that meet a clear requirement as fast as possible. I expect artists and designers who are working in the second category to use AI in one way or another within the next 5 years.",1,,,,,Neutral,Neutral
