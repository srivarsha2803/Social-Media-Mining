A 72h sardines in oil fast.

I also listens to a weight loss podcast, learned skills and let go of beliefs that were not serving me.  It was a lot of mental work…

Sufficient_Window599,"5 years on keto. I do enjoy it. Sometimes it does suck when you are on travel and have limited options or craving something sweet. 

But I also remember exactly how hooked on sugar I was. 

My big realization as to it being a real problem was around day 7 or 8 of no carbs. I was desperately craving carbs. I found that if I walked through kitchen and carb-y snacks or food were out that my hands would kind of independently pick stuff up without me thinking. But the biggest eye opener was the floor pizza. 

One of my kids had left a half eaten piece of pizza on the ground on way to empty trash (taking pizza box to trash can outside). This slice had fallen out of box and had ants on it. I see this and my first thought, no joke, was - ""I could eat that"".

This was my big awakening that the sugar need kind of hijacked my brain. Anything that would make me crave ant-covered half eaten garbage pizza had to be bad for me. So I doubled down and eventually the cravings went away. Blood work (cholesterol, blood sugar, a1c, triglycerides) is great.

It also didn't really work as well for me because I wasn't overweight, just trying to slim a bit after my first year of marriage. I did lose weight but I was also running 5x & lifting weights, so I don't know how much the diet actually played a role. My MIL & husband who had more weight to lose, loved it, until again, after a few years it got to be too much. I enjoyed how clear my mind felt & that I never got bloated though.

I absolutely think it can be beneficial for people but if you have a demanding career, it can be a lot of work to actually stay in ketosis for a long time. It can be even harder to maintain long-term if you have a partner who isn't doing it with you or if you have children, because now you may have to worry about two different types of meal prep. For me, it's easier to manage a healthy diet & exercise without having to worry about eating the ""wrong"" fruits & veggies or peeing on strips to ensure I'm actually in ketosis.

IcyChampionship3067,"Many people think ""keto"" labeled foods and lots of red meat are magical weight loss, similar to fat-free and gluten-free. Then they don't put in the work to track their macros, so they're often over any reasonable carb limit. Add to that eating high glycemic foods. That's a diet that's going to eventually lead to ""The Bad Thing."" 

I always ask a patient to explain it to me when they tell me they're doing keto. 70% are not actually eating a keto diet. When I explain what it requires and offer to refer to a consult with a keto coach, they mostly decline. 

Most PCPs simply don't have time to keep up on the latest evidence or our ever expanding understanding of medical molecular biology and biochemistry.  

The majority of care providers' experience is with unhealthy diets leading to preventable bad outcomes. So the availability heuristic explains a lot. 

The more PCPs gain experience with successful results, they will be far less likely to react poorly. 

Cardiologists see a lot bad things directly related to high animal fat with high carb. They see a lot more death than a PCP. The paradigm of blaming the steak of a steak & potatoes diet hasn't really shifted to understanding it wasn't the steak, it was the added potatoes with Texas toast. 

Keto is hard to do correctly without tracking those macros. It's also the opposite of every FDA food pyramid we were ever taught. 

Maintaining the micronutrients while staying within your carb limit is challenging, especially in the beginning. Many nutritionists are reacting to that as well. 

A word of caution. Some bodies over produce cholesterol and/or triglycerides. Adding to that burden with saturated fats, animal fats and eggs is simply not helpful. If this runs in your family, it's important to be followed closely if you choose keto. 

As for the general population, I imagine keto gets a negative reaction for the same reasons so many people think keto is a magical weight loss solution — profound misinformation.  

Thank them for their concerns. Acknowledge that you know they are acting out of love. Thank them for sharing information on other options. Tell them you've decided you're going to continue for another 6 months and follow up with blood tests. If it fails, you'll make other choices.

Fognox,"Keto gets flak because it's popular now and goes way against conventional reasoning around nutrition. Whole grains, legumes and fruit are seen as ""bad"", while red meat, cheese and fat are seen as ""good"". This flies completely in the face of the zeitgeist around healthy eating for the last 80 years.

Additionally, when people imagine keto, they imagine a diet where you butter your bacon, not a diet where your diet is based around protein, seeds/nuts and green vegetables. If you actually look at a typical keto diet (particularly one based on weight loss), it actually looks pretty similar to a ""healthy"" diet, just without starch and with more leeway around fat. Over the years I've brought lunches to work and coworkers make mention of how healthy the meals look ----- at least until I show them the fat content, then they're like ""what the actual fuck, how are you not dead"". 

Another point worth mentioning is how common the ""carbs are essential"" or ""carbs are your body's primary energy source"" ideas are. Even people that aren't knowledgeable about anything around nutrition ""know"" that carbohydrates are an important part of each meal, or even the most important part. Cutting them out seems like absolute madness, ranging from ""unhealthy"" to ""depriving your body of energy"". I had a presentation at work around healthy eating a few years back where the presenter mentioned how important complex carbs were to energy -- meanwhile I'm the fastest person in the department, racking 10 hour physical job shifts on 20g carbs and 300g of fat. 

I wish the knowledge around keto was more common, or I'd even take basic nutritional science. Carbs aren't your only energy source -- that alone would be good enough.

iamintheforest,"There is a large body of research that shows that saturated fat is bad.  Further, there is some research that shows increase in LDL (bad cholesterol) on keto.  I have developed a few opinions here:

1. the keto and LDL connection is real, but often confounded by the impact of weight loss on LDL.  Also worth noting that the data on LDL and it's status as an indicator of future health disease in isolation of other factors is getting weaker by the day.  But...If you lose a lot of weight quickly your LDL is likely to rise regardless of what you're eating.  Since much of the impulse for ketogenic diets is wrapped in weight loss ambitions this seems like a rough connection and needs more research.  Speaking anecdotally I went keto for blood glucose regulation (wanted to be steady, not heavily fluctuating) and not for weight loss (former pro athlete, have struggled to gain weight not lose it, etc.) and while I never had cholesterol problems on Keto they got better, not worse.

2. doing keto half-assed is - I believe - an increase in risk relative to a classic ""moderately low carb Mediterranean diet"".  Why?  Because saturated fat in the presence of high glucose is definitely, non-controversially awful for you.  I think we can attribute the health disaster of the american diet on carbs + fat at the same time.  So...if you fail to reduce carbs sufficiently AND increase saturated fats that's probably pretty bad over a long run.  That's what ""Half ass keto"" can do.

3.  Insulin and blood glucose are pretty harmful to your body.  Keto lowers both of these (insulin being THE control mechanism for ketone production/cessation and glucose being the thing that triggers insulin creation).  If you have to choose between LDL and high insulin and glucose I think LDL is a great choice to have more elevated than glucose/insulin.  For about half the american population this choice is very very real given the prevalence of insulin resistance (which causes higher glucose levels and gets your pancreas to pump out even more insulin to compensate, eventually failing to do so - aka diabetes or pre-diabetes).

4. For me being in ""ketosis"" isn't actually important to me from my understanding of my health.  However, it's _easier_ to be in ketosis than to try to sustain a regulated glucose/insulin level at ""low carb"" levels - the roller coaster of glucose makes it harder to get the glucose/insulin outcome I want (this is doubly true for severe diabetics).  So...keto is _practical_ in this regard since I've dismissed the idea that i need to being fighting biology with some force of will as if my mind and my body aren't the same system!  

5. Similar to 4, but another practical angle. The popularity of keto means that there is lots and lots of cooking/recipe advice and I LOVE cooking and love food.  So...it's just practical to be attached to a diet that is popular and has things like this sub.  I find the commercialization of ""net carbs"" extraordinarily problematic (you only need a little time on a CGM and a little understanding of the FDA testing methods allowed for carbs to learn that it's a landmine of false information (see the sugar alcohols portion of the FAQ here, but a similar problem exists for fiber leading to the business side of food trying to capitalize on ""keto"" and just not doing a great job!).  So...if you look around you'll see an increasing prevalence of highly processed foods in the keto landscape.  I think this poses a risk of other health issues and also serves to keep people attached to food habits from their high carb days.  I find whole, health, fatty stuff from nature to be the best way and am wary of the current commercial trends (to say the least).  I question whether I could eat keto the way _I think_ is healthy and works for me if I were not doing well financially.  Cost per calorie on Keto is high if you're following the principles I try to.

Fair or not, veganism has a militant stigma for most of society, so for someone to break through that and make the effort, day by day, to make little changes and learn the process of figuring out life without animal products...it really takes someone who cares a lot and doesn't worry about perceptions or labels.

When you shop, glance at the ingredients list and do your best. If you see “milk powder”, skip that one and buy something else. It’s ok if you don’t cut out those final 1% items overnight. Challenge yourself to Google at least 1 ingredient each time you’re at the grocery store until you eventually get them all down. There’s random animal products everywhere. It took me a year of being vegan before I heard about white sugar and bone char (but since I learned about it, I immediately cut it out). You pick these things up over time.

Early on, I took steps such as: being vegetarian at home and only eating meat when I went out, having ""vegan weeks"" where I would challenge myself to be fully vegan for a week, cutting out what I deemed to be more ""problematic"" foods such as foie gras, lamb, veal, duck etc and other baby animals, and more.

People in these stages probably will find themselves being vegan eventually. I got so much positive feedback during that time, it was a good motivator. I think demonising people who are say, vegan except one thing, is not the right way to go about it. Most of the time they'll get there on their own, and even if they don't, their diet isn't the one we need to be criticising, as it's still FAR from the SWD (standard western diet).",1688194035,5,vegan

Next, I agree that making vegan choices seems almost too easy in 2023 and it feels odd. After all, we’re told by non-vegans that it’s just too hard/ too much of a shock to the system/ there are no good options/ it’s inconvenient/ etc. After a bit of time though, we discover all the choices that we have in food, fashion, cosmetics, even luxury items like going to a spa or getting a manicure. The fact that it’s NOT hard does feel suspicious, like ‘am I doing this wrong?’

Finally, enjoy the process! Not everyone is the perfect vegan from the word go. Most of us got there gradually, often by using up non-vegan items that we’d already purchased, then choosing the vegan and cruelty free option when replenishing whatever it was.

I think many people are unnecessarily harsh towards newbies who are most of the way there, and not totally there just yet. I feel their judgment is discouraging and demotivating, so I hope you can overlook some of the comments that are impatient and unsupportive.

kharvel0,"I only mock plant-based dieting speciesists and animal-ag shills who masquerade as ""vegans"" and try to dilute the meaning of veganism to the point where it becomes meaningless and anyone can declare themselves to be “vegan” whilst contributing to or participating in the deliberate and intentional exploitation, abuse, and/or killing of innocent animals. I’ve taken the liberty of classifying them by categories as follows:

**Class 1: Non-Sentientists**

Oyster boys - people who claim that bivalves are not sentient and eating them is “vegan”.

Pescatarians - people who claim that fish are not sentient and eating them is “vegan”.

Entomophagists - people who claim that insects are not sentient and eating them is “vegan”.

**Class 2: Plant-based Dieting Speciesists**

This class is pernicious to the vegan movement as they are plant-based dieters who masquerade as “vegans” while at the same time happily fund the violent killing of innocent animals to feed certain animals that they keep in captivity on basis of species. These people make comments like the ones paraphrased below that just highlights their speciesism and their non-veganism:

*Innocent animals would have been abused/killed by someone else anyway to feed my pet python so I might as capture live rats myself and feed them to the python and still call myself vegan!*

*I happily purchase animal products from slaughterhouses to feed my pet animal but I am still vegan because I don’t consume the animal products!*

*My cat is a carnivore and I love my cat. I will gladly kill innocent lambs and piglets every year to feed my cat and keep her happy. I’m still vegan!!*

*My dog is so friendly and loves me so much. But she hates the plant-based foods. So it pains me to purchase animal products from slaughterhouses that violently kill innocent animals. But I consider myself to be a vegan!!*

*My senior dog requires a medical prescription of 100 bloody goat carcasses every year to survive. I am okay with beheading 100 goats every year to keep my dog alive and I’m still think I’m vegan!*

*I never allow any animal products to be brought into my house by anyone because my house is a vegan house. I make an exception for myself when I purchase animal products and bring it into my house to feed my cat.*

**Class 3: WhatAboutIsts**

This class comprises of apologist vegans who use classic carnist whataboutisms and talking points to defend non-vegans, omnis, plant-based dieting speciesists, animal-ag shills even if they themselves do not believe these people are vegan.

**Class 4: Animal-Ag Shills**

Carnists, omnis, and plant-based quislings working for the animal agriculture lobby who masquerade as “vegans” using “x years vegan” flairs/tags and engage in spreading fear, confusion, and doubt throughout the vegan community in order to dilute the meaning of veganism and push the odious notion that purchasing animal products is “vegan”.",1731470295,-2,vegan

rocknrollwitch,"Going Paleo in 2012 helped me understand a lot of my food sensitivities and reactions, many of which were behind my constant GI woes and near-constant fatigue. Seeing the changes that occurred not only physically but psychologically through dietary changes also helped spark an ongoing passion in nutrition and biochemistry for me. I even changed my major in college to reflect this newfound interest (didn't finish tho, teehee)

I left the Paleo community in general when political views started to become conflated with dietary changes and exercise preferences.

That said, I've really only kept up with the dietary and lifestyle changes that have made the most difference for me. Gluten remains an absolute no. I eat few fruits and some veggies. I can tolerate some dairy (mostly cheeses). I keep seed oils to a minimum but I'm not afraid of some French fries. I almost never drink sugar but I'll have a diet coke as a treat every now and then. And I'll definitely indulge in the oft-demonized ""gluten-free/Paleo junk food"" a few times a week (those Lesser Evil Paleo Puffs RULE omg). And I'm Mexican, so corn tortillas are NEVER leaving my diet. I also walk at least 10-15k steps a day because I have an active job and I try to lift heavy stuff 3 times a week.

37thAndOStreet,"Very cool discussion, OP! It's 8 years almost to the day since I started Paleo. I wanted to get a six pack and Google led me to some Paleo blogs. I started paleo and CrossFit around the same time, right before my 25th birthday.

I remember throwing out the sugary and non Paleo stuff in my cupboard, like Aunt Jemima syrup (to replace it with organic maple syrup). My CrossFit coach said that almost no one in our particular box was really Paleo, although he explained more about Paleo to me when I asked, and I remember one member mentioning Whole 30 at one point.

I was pretty religiously Paleo for about 2 years. Didn't have a vanilla milkshake with sprinkles mixed in (possibly my fav food) for two full years. I did get down to a six pack that I was proud enough about to look for any excuse to take my shirt off lol. 

A major life crisis happened that dislodged the rhythm I had. It took about a year for the six pack to become completely non-visible although the work outs in CrossFit were so strong that I can still feel the six pack muscles, the biceps and a little bit of the pecs to this day. I tried and failed to reboot both Paleo and CrossFit a lot during the pandemic, although I was overall too depressed from a continuous stream of crises.

The most successful weight loss methods for me have been calories in calories out methods that do let you have some non paleo treats -- as well as, unfortunately, involuntary methods of weight loss, like extreme poverty, at times, or situations where I was being malnourished while in the care of others.

I still kind of am Paleo in some of my beliefs about food, some of the ways I navigate the supermarket, the way I'm seen among my friends as the one who used to be passionate about Paleo and CrossFit, and whatever else I can hold onto from those two years, which were some of my fav years of life. 

I drink red wine as my favorite alcohol where possible. I don't touch beer, although I do drink White Claws now, and I allow a fruit juice (oh no) when I make whiskey lemonade. The recipes I use to make margaritas and mojitos are actually both Paleo versions. Amidst it all, it was actually only literally within the past week that I started drinking apple juice recreationally again, and every so often there will be experiences like that where I re-engage with a food I haven't touched in several years. I drink almond milk and that's a hard preference. I am extremely unlikely to return to regular milk anytime soon.

I feel like a lot of my willingness to do Paleo was because I only knew about a relatively small number of foods and had been eating like a college student. It's harder to do now that I know what a broad array of foods there is out there. 

I've ballooned up and down 70 pounds multiple times throughout the pandemic and ensuing years. I'm relatively near my peak of CrossFit level of skinny right now -- unfortunately due to one of those periods of malnourishment. Pizza is the thing that really makes me gain weight, so even when I'm eating Doordash a lot, I look good. And who knows what the future holds, as far as returning to either Paleo or CrossFit, or both. 

Some of the fundamental problems that have terrorized my life for the past 6 years have been solved. So I'm excited to look and see what's next. I have different ideals of body image right now than I did when I started Paleo. I'm kind of intrigued by the dad bod transformations that happen in men's 30s and 40s, so when I sit down to plan my next big fashion push, I might want to find a hybrid between being thick and meaty while also being trim. I like the way Nick Carter and Justin Timberlake look right now, for example. I wonder if society has changed over these few years and dad bod is just considered hot now in a way that it wasn't back then. 

I remember specifically referencing Zac Efron as well as a social media account called The Warwick Rowers as my ideals back then. If I had to fit one fitness role model right now, well, idk. Pietro Boselli is pretty nice, and a lot of TikTok and OF influencers have influence on me. I have trouble seeing myself ever divesting from wanting a six pack.

I started slipping backwards slowly (meeting my wife and her family, who are hardcore standard American dieters didn’t help), and I found myself to the point where I was just eating gluten free. But I recommitted myself about a month or so ago (tired of feeling bloated and like crap all the time) and I’m remembering how much I loved it. 

I’m not 100% paleo but I think I keep a good balance. I don’t like sweet potatoes so I eat white ones (and I think it’s total BS to suggest white potatoes are not paleo); I have a glass of wine with dinner, and homemade airpopped popcorn once every week or two. And when we go out to eat, I keep it as paleo as possible/reasonable, but I don’t stress like I used to. If a food makes me feel bad, I don’t eat it. If it doesn’t make me feel bad, and it’s not paleo, I consider it a treat and I try to limit it. I had gluten free cake on my birthday.  

So many of my family members have sensitivities to foods, and it blows my mind they’d rather just have stomach cramps and diarrhea every evening than just not eat dairy. But, I digress.",1686927404,15,paleo
ceemko,"For me personally, paleo was amazing to push a concept of healthy eating through putting it into some easy to understand framework. 

At the time when I was learning about paleo, keto sounded super unhealthy, because people were just posting images of dipping bacon into mayonaise. I think it naturally came to an intersection, where what I considered paleo back when I started, is now 'clean keto'. Everything that goes hand in hand with taking care of your health, ilke intermittent fasting, elimination diet, understanding of impact of sugar and gluten, and trying to limit artificial and overly processed food just makes sense once you start digging into it a bit more.

No matter how you label it, if you adjust it to your own body by doing some well informed modifications and verifications with how you react to the food you eat, you can't go wrong.

Where I was making bad dietary decisions with wrong information, I am able to make now well informed mistakes, and while I pretty much only lurk, paleo subreddit set me on this path (and I found out about paleo from some random loseit post).",1686902646,9,paleo
WendyPortledge,"I started with AIP about 7 years ago. I’m what I call “personalized paleo” now and have been for many years. I eat some grains and potatoes. For me, it’s just eating real food. I have autoimmune conditions they are triggered by foods and unnatural ingredients. I find Paleo is the easiest way to describe how I eat, however when I explained it to my doctor he wrote it down as Neolithic Diet, not Paleo. While that may be slightly more accurate due to allowing grains, very few are aware of the Neolithic diet. 

It looks like Keto pushed harder and made its way into mainstream marketing far beyond Paleo. Probably because they allow cheap alcohol sugars that big companies love. More products they can produce cheaply, slap the Keto word on, and make a profit, just like “plant-based”.",1686914065,7,paleo

I’m not “strict,” whatever that would mean with something that’s supposed to be a set of healthy practices, but I definitely use the principles as much as I can.  Walk a lot, get fresh air and sun, limit screen time, have affection and physical contact with people in your life, socialize, pursue art music and skills that interest you, don’t eat processed junk (well…not often anyway).

The one time I actually succeeded in having a mostly Paleo diet (2011) I was the healthiest I'd been. Healthy weight, better mental health, better digestive health, less pain, less acne and rosacea.

I lost 42 pounds after I gave birth to my son thanks to the paleo diet.  I got to a point 12 years later, I had to do something about the weight I gained due to emotional eating. Paleo is much easier eating out and sustainable vs being vegan I've encountered. Most vegan options are fries, side salad and a processed burger when eating out.

My health was always questionable growing up, with some of my most prominent childhood memories being extremely painful stomach aches and digestive issues. Paleo fixed almost all of that for me.

I think Paleo is the best baseline introductory healthy diet for people who might not be able to cut tons and tons of things out. Paleo cuts out a lot of the worst things and can give a lot of people some relief to their health issues without it being overly restrictive. I actually do not think it's strict at all, but that could be my own bias since I've done much stricter diets like Vegan or carnivore (yes, both).

I personally go further with it and cut out greens, seeds, and nuts in addition to the other things Paleo does, but that's just what works best for me. My diet is essentially an animal-based Paleo diet that includes what I believe to be the ""lowest toxin"" plants that I digest fine like fruit, allium, herbs, mushrooms (technically not a plant, but), root vegetables, skinned potatoes, and white rice. And I make sure to only eat what's in season, so Winter is essentially a carnivore diet with bits of potato  and roots here and there, while Summer has a lot more fruit.

I don't care what my labels are or what people think is ""in."" I've been studying nutrition for almost a decade and have radically turned around my health in my ways. I'm always evolving and tweaking things to suit my needs, and I'm always open to learning more and making what changes I deem to be healthy or necessary.

I know from experience that this means I may eat a less than optimal meal 1-3x per week. One needs to be pretty good at mentally analysing food composition to do this so that it does not impact the benefits of the paleo diet too much. 

The diet is only part of the life way, not living like a caveman but mimicking the essential characteristics of the circumstances we evolved in.

“It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes. Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources and are associated with much less environmental damage. Vegetarians and vegans are at reduced risk of certain health conditions, including ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain types of cancer, and obesity. Low intake of saturated fat and high intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, soy products, nuts, and seeds (all rich in fiber and phytochemicals) are characteristics of vegetarian and vegan diets that produce lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and better serum glucose control. These factors contribute to reduction of chronic disease.

Humans are omnivores, and what that *actually means* is that a vegan diet is sustainable long-term (as well as one based exclusively on animal products). There are no essential macronutrients or micronutrients that you can't get from cutting out animal products, and you can formulate a vegan diet all sorts of different ways. 

Ultimately, do what works best for you and your body. If you feel healthier on a vegan diet, go for it. If you don't, then stop.",1723011327,5,vegan

Most studies aren't very complete. Science is ever changing as we found out during covid. We also found out that it's very easy to be bought and paid for your expert opinions. The problem with the science behind diets is that human bodies are all so different. I know vegan athletes that do fine. I know ex vegans that ate very well and are active, but fixed health issues by adding eggs. I personally can't eat a lot of grains or legumes. So to say that a specific diet is best, doesn't really work. Also most studies about diets and health aren't taking in consideration of lifestyle difference. I'm not saying hotdogs are healthy, but some one that eats a hot dog is probably more likely to be less active, higher chance of eating chips and drinking sugar beverages. Compare to a vegetarian, who is more likely to be active and less likely to drink or smoke. So diets aren't the only thing that make people healthy. Its life style, stress levels, genetics... Another thing that a scientist at my old job told me, was that to truly see the differences between diets, you need to have genetically identical people to study. They have done a few twins studies that I've seen, and it seems that there's pros and cons for both sides. I've done many diets, and I've paid thousands of dollars to people to help with food issues.

Not to be that person, but it is actually really important to be mindful of your protein if you go vegan. You CAN get your protein in, but it’s something you have to be much more conscious of. Ive experienced hormonal imbalances and nutrient deficiencies from not eating enough protein and now that I’m eating animal protein again, I actually feel much better and more energetic and have improved my hormones.

DavidAg02,"I did plant based for a year... not true vegan, but 90% of what I ate was whole, unprocessed plants and the remaining 10% was processed vegan/vegetarian foods. 

For a very short time, I felt great. I think that is the result of eliminating a lot of the processed foods and drastically reducing the amount of sugar I was eating. 

That lasted for about 2 months. For the remainder of that year, I continued to feel worse and worse. It started with mild gas and bloating. I took some Tums and pushed through it, thinking it was just my body adjusting to the increased amount of fiber. It never went away and just got worse as the months went by. 

I was losing weight... except I didn't want to be losing weight, I wanted to be gaining weight. So what was happening? I was pretty darn sure I was eating enough calories. 

I had done a DEXA scan about a year or so before, and decided to go get another one. To my absolute shock, the weight I had lost had mostly come from muscle. I had lost a crazy amount of muscle mass in about 6 months of eating plant based, and my performance in the gym and how I looked absolutely confirmed that.

Ok, so how do I fix this? More protein, right? So I went hardcore on the plant based protein. Seitan/tofu/tvp/etc. However, as soon as I started doing this, the gas and bloating got worse AND I was finding it really difficult to eat enough of those very dense foods to get the amount of protein I was wanting to get. Impossible? No. Extremely difficult? Yes. 

So for the remaining 6 months, I basically force fed myself plant based protein and continued to feel gassy and bloated ALL OF THE TIME. I was miserable, and gave it up after a year. 

I now eat omnivore (50/50 plant and animal sources) but have continued to eat whole/unprocessed foods the vast majority of the time. I feel so much better. The gas and bloating are gone. My blood markers are ""extremely good"" according to my doctor, I'm killing it in the gym, very happy with how I look... basically all good things and this way of eating is very simple and sustainable to me.

HawkAsAWeapon,"This is purely anecdotal, but this has been my experience.

Before going vegan four years ago I ate a pretty decent diet. I went for leaner meats, had a fair amount of veggies etc. but probably a bit too much cheese.

I went vegan for environmental reasons and expected to feel a bit rubbish, as I have a very fast metabolism and need to eat a lot. A couple of weeks in to being vegan I felt amazing. My energy levels were constant and high (no more food comas even when completely full), and my nails were hard and shiny and my skin clearer. At this point I wasn't even particularly conscious of nutrition.

Since then I've become far more nutritionally-minded and feel even healthier, fitter, and stronger than ever before, despite being 4 years older and passing that 30 threshold.  I follow a predominantly whole-food plant-based diet. The thought of reintroducing any animal product into my diet (aside from ethical considerations) just seems like a massive step backwards. I'm seeing other people my age becoming overweight and looking significantly older, and whilst there may be other lifestyle factors at play I'm confident that my diet is something that is keeping me youthful and energetic whilst others are already experiencing decline.

As long as you are ticking all your nutritional boxes, a plant-based diet eliminates all those nasties. Saturated fat, cholesterol, inflammatory compounds etc., whilst more plants means more antioxidants and phytonutrients that reduce inflammation and prevent cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc.

Aside from nutrition, a plant-based/vegan diet reduces your environmental impact on the world significantly (environmental health is just as important as individual health), and reduces as far as possible your contribution to animal suffering and killing.

Based on my experience of having tried a vegan diet and tracking my nutrient intake this deeply, I will say this:

Meeting all vitamins and minerals is a lot more challenging. I won’t say it’s nearly impossible, but in my opinion, it’s unrealistic to sustain long-term unless you supplement and eat fortified foods.

When I followed a vegan diet, I had to eat nutrient-fortified foods to meet the vitamins and minerals I was tracking. However, I think these types of foods are more processed.

mindgamesweldon,"I would say, go where the scientific consensus leads.

Gregor does have a particular stance, and it’s foolish to believe he doesn’t have a bias. HOWEVER, his published works go through a team of paid and volunteer readers that process the field of nutrition research and put together the majority consensus.

Remember that scientific journals are not “truth” publishers. Rather, scientific journals are a messaging system for scientists to send DMs to each other. It’s just that the DMs are experiments and results, followed by a discussion section (author opinions). Scientists read their peers work, and then write a grant, fund it, hire assistant researchers, arrange a study, run a study, analyze results, then publish their “response” DM (on a 3-10 year time lag).

So to be a science reporter, you can’t read a single experiment and take away a result. You have to scroll back in the DMs and read the conversation from the start and follow along.

Gregor has a large non profit that does that, and conglomerates the current “majority opinion” of the chat group.

Berg is a chiropractic-turned-YouTuber. Being in a quack profession like chiropracty doesn’t automatically make you a quack. But in his case he makes his money off his brand of being a contrarian to most of the majority opinions of the scientific community (the main ones being that vaccines are effective at preventing massive humanitarian crises, cholesterol is real, and that keto is a specific diet invented to help patients who are wracked with a certain kind of seizure as well as a good temporary elimination diet to investigate allergic responses while being very unhealthy for longevity)

EDIT: and as per your debate of what to do. Just keep reading. Consume all of Gregor’s literature. Then go listen to all of Valter Longo’s research.

my personal take away diet wise after graduating is that i use cronometer to track my intake so i have a good idea of what im eating macro and micro nutrient wise. i also eat a vegan diet but thats a personal decision i made based on the research i did both in terms of health and ethics that might not be for everyone. keto is not a sustainable diet and it does not have any long term positives unless you are using the diet medically to treat epilepsy.",1706180737,11,keto

So, I would tend to believe his research and books over others.   Check out How Not To Die by Dr. Greger, too.  What I dislike and find very unhealthy about a true Keto diet is the lack of fruits and vegetables.  Fruits and veggies are where you get the majority of your vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.    The things eaten on the keto diet are meat and cheese and fake sugar foods, from what I've seen.  All of which contain very few of the things our bodies need to prevent diseases.   One good aspect of Keto (and probably why it works, along with a calorie deficit) is no sugar.

jpl19335,"This is going to be a little tough to explain, but one sign that I look for in determining who to listen to comes down to one question: what are these folks focusing on?  On mechanism or outcomes?  Outcomes are what really matter.  You mentioned oatmeal.  Is it healthy?  Well, I can take ANY food and show how it has bad side-effects when studied in a lab in isolation.  I don't care what it is.  Broccoli?  Yep... beef? yep.  Point is, while mechanism is important in helping scientists develop a hypothesis about food and nutrition, it's a STARTING point.  It should never be an ending point.  The only time mechanistic data should rule is if it's the only data we have at that point.

So, go look it up... for populations that eat alot of grains like oatmeal, how do they do?  Do they live longer/healthier lives than the general population or not?  What are their biomarkers like?  Cholesterol, BMI, etc.  Because THOSE are the markers of a healthy diet.  I'll spoil the ending for you - those populations have lower cholesterol, BMI, BP, and chronic disease than other populations.  Listen to someone tell you you should avoid beans, e.g., because of lectins, and I can point out how populations that eat alot beans live long, healthy lives.  These folks can take their mechanistic data for all they want.  I base my decisions on outcome.  Mechanism says you should avoid soy, e.g., but outcomes say the exact opposite.  I'll eat the beans, thank you very much.  I'll eat the nuts.  I'll eat the oatmeal (which I do, sometimes 2 or 3 times a day).  I'll up my fiber.  I'll get lots of fruit and veggies (listen to someone like Gundry who tells you to avoid most fruit because it has as much sugar as a candy bar... ugh... yes, that's true, but so what?  How do fruit-eaters fare?  REALLY damn well... so, pass the grapes, please.).

One thing I learned is just because a diet makes you lose weight is not a guarantee it’s healthy. Losing weight is indicative of a stressor in the grand scheme of things. I’d use it maybe for a week or 2 if I had to lose weight for an event or if I was morbidly obese on deaths door but surely not a lifelong diet. Just cut out the obvious problems - packaged food, lower stress, sleep, movement, fried stuff, heaps of sugar, cheap oils, some people have crazy allergies to gluten and dairy sadly, me being one of them.

Regarding meat, I believe quality matters. I also believe we need to be wary of when and how much and how often. But eating NO meat I think is problematic (in the long run).",1706171144,0,keto

blondiecats,"I heard a while back that any diet with a specific name (keto, paleo, atkins, whatever) is just trash, all of it. 

Just eat healthy in moderation. I personally can’t stand the keto diet because I don’t eat meat and my husband did it for like, a year, and I was so worried about all the meat he was consuming. 

Just eat water-rich, whole foods, meal prep, avoid refined sugar (or at least too much refined sugar), remember that healthy fats are good for you (nuts, avocado etc.), seitan and tofu are excellent sources of protein if you’re plant-based (or looking into it) and you’ll be fine.",1706197935,0,keto

-Xserco-,"Michael is a massive quack like a large portion of the industry.

Berg is also a quack.

Neither of them are credible sources of nutrition research and information. They both abuse a title to seem as though they're more in the know than everyone else.

Unless you need to follow a specific diet, eat all food groups. Stop listening to ""XYZ = cancer"" because they don't know what they're talking about.",1706177331,-5,keto
