## 1. Comparing the Artistic Value of AI-Generated Art and Human-Created Art on Reddit
##Introduction
This paper examines the debate surrounding AI-generated art versus human-created art, focusing on perceptions within Reddit communities. It analyzes discussions on artistic authenticity, creativity, and emotional impact, providing insights into how different online communities react to AI's role in the creative space.

## 3. Analyzing Customer Sentiments and Recommendation Factors in Airline Reviews
##Introduction
This research investigates how various aspects of airline service—such as seat comfort, staff service, and in-flight entertainment—affect customer sentiments and their likelihood of recommending an airline. Using sentiment analysis and machine learning models, the study predicts airline recommendations based on customer reviews.

##Conclusion
The study found that overall rating and value for money were the strongest predictors of customer recommendations. Negative sentiments were linked to delays and poor service, while positive emotions like trust and joy correlated with high customer satisfaction. The findings highlight key areas for airlines to improve customer experiences and increase loyalty.
